For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower,


### Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research


Research process was relatively difficult as this task was not common on the internet, other challenges I found either allowed the use of adhesives or the use of multiple sheets of paper. 

Through seeing designs from other challenges I found that cleverly splitting the design length-wise would be the best idea, the only challenge was to find how to connect 2 sides with adhesives.

My plan was to split the paper 8.5x11" into 22x 8.5x0.5" strips and then stack them into rectangular recursive shapes.

(The strips were then folded 4 times to make it thick)



### Ideation

*You will create quick sketches or descriptions of your planned design*

### Prototyping

While I did not have any pictures of the failed building process, the paper structure did not hold due to the lack of structure in the shapes.

### Testing and Critique

Plan out better next time and visualize the structure. Before I build it :o(

### Final design

Make designs like other with the stacking triangular shapes.


### Conclusion

Did not have time unfortunately.
